                        title ~~
addMissingVals          Add clones that haven't been counted If clones
                        haven't been counted they don't appear rather
                        than count as zero
format_exp_data         Calculate proportions with 95% credible
                        interval (confidence interval). If there are
                        replicates they will be pooled(!). It will work
                        for both count table format and list format.
format_list2tbl         Transform list format to table format with
                        clone size along rows and time points along
                        cols. Will return time points as colnames. This
                        is the format used for inference If a clone
                        size does not appear in any data point it will
                        not be included (!!!)
format_tbl2list         Transform tbl format to list format. Useful for
                        ggplot plotting
